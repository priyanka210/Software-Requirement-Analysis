# Class Attendance Forecasting System (CAFS)

## Overview
The Class Attendance Forecasting System (CAFS) aims to enhance the operational efficiency and resource management of fitness studios partnered with ClassPass. By leveraging data science and machine learning, CAFS optimizes class schedules, allocates resources effectively, and provides actionable insights through reporting and analytics.

## Motivation
ClassPass users often face difficulties in booking classes due to unavailability during peak hours, while businesses suffer from under-enrollment during off-peak times. CAFS addresses these challenges by predicting class attendance and optimizing schedules, thereby improving resource utilization and customer satisfaction.

This project is part of CS6525 – Software Requirements Analysis at the University of New Brunswick and is based on unfounded assumptions and “best guesses” made by the author. The objective is to simulate how requirements analysis might have been documented during the development of an information system similar to ClassPass’s.
